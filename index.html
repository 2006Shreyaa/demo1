        <h1> I Love <br>Mumbai </h1>
        <p>
            Mumbai was named after a local goddess, Mumba Devi in 1995. The history of this spectacular and modern city
            dates back to the rule of the famous King Ashoka. These seven islands were under the rule of him until his
            demise. After his demise, it was ruled by various rulers. And finally, these isles were handed over to the
            East India Company by the Portuguese in 1668, and then it was named “Bombay”.
